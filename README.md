# SUSU-Money-Lending-Software
<b>SUSU Money Lending PHP Script</b>

SUSU Money Lending PHP Software is a community-based savings practice where family and friends come together in order to borrow and lend money to each other. Users start groups with friends and family to achieve short-term financial goals like starting a business, paying medical bills, tuition fees, a down payment for a home, and more. A group of people get together and contribute a set amount towards the financial goal of one person in the group. This happens every week or month when the money is distributed to a different member in rotation until everyone has received a payout towards their financial goals. The payout can range from a few dollars to hundreds of dollars based on the economic capability of the group. Members are put in a queue based on need in order to get their payout, but a lottery system could ascertain who gets a payout and when as well. An organizer collects these payments and distributes them. The group is usually family and friends who are trustworthy. Microfinance Savings PHP Software developed in CodeIgniter PHP with MySQL database. Microfinance Savings PHP Script helps manage SUSU Savings plans, members, winners, transactions, withdrawals, and more. The SUSU Savings PHP script has two users: an Admin and Users or Members. Phpscriptsonline offers complete script and full source code, so you can use this project for your personal and client projects, and can be modified source code per your future business requirements.
